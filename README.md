# snapshot-chess-move
## WORK in Progress - A snapshot of a chess board and men along with a description and ranking for a next move.

With the goal to create a searchable wiki of chess moves. The idea being simply why do computer chess programs continue to (re-) compute the same board over and over again usually arriving at the same next move when a wiki of searchable chess moves can be created to hold that move.  Then, future chess programs become a simple search and take the next move based on a rank very quickly.  Progressively, the wiki runs out of next moves; So, the computer is employeed to find it.  Eventually, the wiki fills to completion and the chess game becomes as easy as tic-tac-toe.  Yes. it will happen and your welcome to join this effort. So, lets start by creating a tic-tac-toe wiki of moves; it may prove enlighting.
